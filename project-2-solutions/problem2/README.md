# Problem 2

Before running, remember to activate the virtual environment

```bash
. ../../venv/bin/activate
```

if you have not set up the virtual environment yet, look at the instructions at the [course website](https://kinanbab.github.io/CS591L1/) for details on how to set it up.

## Running

Use these commands to run this problem:

```bash
python3 test1.py # runs part 1
python3 test2.py # runs part 2

# the bonus part has two tests that can be run as follows
cd part3-bonus
python3 test1.py
python3 test2.py
```
