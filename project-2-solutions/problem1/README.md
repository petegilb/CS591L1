# Problem 2

Before running, remember to activate the virtual environment

```bash
. ../../venv/bin/activate
```

if you have not set up the virtual environment yet, look at the instructions at the [course website](https://kinanbab.github.io/CS591L1/) for details on how to set it up.

## Running

Part 1 has several test files, parts 2 and 3 have one test file. They can be run as follows:

```bash
# Part 1 tests
python3 part1.py test1.py
python3 part1.py test2.py
python3 part1.py test3.py

# Part 1 and Part 2
python3 part1.py test4.py

# Part 3
python3 part3.py test5.py # instrumentation
python3 test5.py # aspect-oriented programming
```
