    "### Other Interesting Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other interesting aspects of SQLAlchemy that are worth further discussion. For brievity, we only highlight a couple of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lazy loading of relationships: properties (both static and object-bound) of module classes and objects are instrumented. This means that accessing them triggers a python hook defined within SQLAlchemy, which can modify how the access work. In particular, for object-bound attributes matching static attributes of relationships (e.g. artist.albums), this hook checks whether the relationship was previously loaded, and loads it from the database using SQL queries if it needs to, before returning the result. This can be achieved via reflection (e.g. by overriding \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Migrations and schema consistency: SQLAlchemy builds a graph-like data structure that stores the defined modules and their dependencies. This is done via the metaclass. This gives SQLAlchemy the chance to check whether the schema has been modified after the database was created, since it can also query the database for schematic information, and compare the two. This gives SQLAlchemy the ability to generate and manage SQL statements for altering the schema. Because of how critical and dangerous schema editing can be, SQLAlchemy generate python files called \"migrations\", that can be run via SQLAlchemy manaully, to generate and execute SQL statments for altering the schema, within safe transaction blocks. You can read more about this [here](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html)."
