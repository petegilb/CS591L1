    "In this problem, you were tasked with implementing a tool that can analyze programs, and statically enforce that protected variables in these programs are never assigned null. In these notes, we will restrict ourselves to python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the problem restricted the constructs that the tool must support to be: (1) function definitions (2) function calls (3) variable assignment (4) and return statements. This will be the restricted syntax of our supported subset of the python language:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "program := statement*\n",
    "statement := functionDefinition | functionCall | assignmentStatement | returnStatement\n",
    "\n",
    "functionDefinition := 'def' identifier '(' (identifier ( ',' identifier )* )? ')' ':' statement*\n",

    "expression := numericaLiteral | stringLiteral | 'None' | identifier | functionCall\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem relies on regular python semantics. These can be formally defined in many ways. We will not attempt to formalize them here. The semantics are more or less obvious due to the extreme restrictions on our syntax. Note that in a formal tool with associated formal proofs the semantics need to be defined rigorously.\n",

    "## Null-Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem definition outlines the different cases that the tool must check for. These cases are shown in an intuitive way in the problem definition for simplicity, and appear ad-hoc. However, they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to produce such list of cases is to go over all combinations of statements allowed by the syntax, look at their associated formal semantics, and list charactristics of which combinations are forbidden. This was indeed our thought process while creating the homework description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the restricted sytnax (and associated semantics) shown above. Which of the statements can affect null-safety? Null-safety is a property of varaibles. Therefore, the statements that can affect it are statements that change the value assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious case is variable assignment. It can assign None directly to a varaible, or indirectly by assigning a variable or expression whose value is really None. This is the first case our tool must check for. Note that this already creates a first difficulty. We need to devise a way that allows us to determine if a variable is None or not to be able to check assignments to other variables, as well as a similar way to determine if a function call returns None or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second case is more implicit: function calling. When a function is called, the given arguments are assigned to the function parameters. If some of the function parameters are protected, then the function cannot be called in a way that sets these parameters to None, either directly (by passing None explicitly) or indirectly (by passing an expressions whose value is None). We are faced with the same difficulty here, since arguments in a function call can be a variable or an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, determining if an expression is None or not with absolute accuracy is undecidable. However, we can be conservative. We can come up with an approach that detects None expressions always, but may mistake some expressions that are not None as None expressions. Another way to describe such an approach is to say that it errors on the side of caution, when it cannot determine if an expression is None or not, it will assume it is None to be safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one fundemental idea behind type systems in programming languages. A strongly typed programming language can sometimes restrict the behavior of the programmer in certain cases when the type checker cannot really determine if the expressions match up to the right type. In such cases, the programmer is required to perform some additional work to convince the type checker that things are ok, or to tell the type checker to accept the expressions, one example is type casting (e.g. in Java or C++).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem does not require that the tool be implemented using types. Mainly because python is not statically typed, and it will be too cumbersome to change it to support better static typing for null-safety. Instead, the problem suggests a different approach, variables (and functions) whose names start with '\\_n\\_' are assumed to be protected (i.e. have a null-safe types), while other are assumed to be unprotected (i.e. have a nullable type).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approache is common in many program analysis tools. Although it may be specified differently. In our case, we require the programmer to input some helpful annotations about the type of variables via their names. Other tools may ask the programmer to input such information using special comments, special syntax, decorators or annotations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this approache gives us a third case to consider. A function that is marked as null-safe (i.e starts with '\\_n\\_') cannot return None (either directly or indirectly via an unsafe expression). Therefore, our tool must look at return statements as well. Note that this solves our previous difficulties: we can now check if a variable or function is safe by checking its name."

    "\n",
    "We can formalize the cases we describe above as rules for our tool. In a more formal setting, we can think of these rules as typing rules indicating how a type checker should work, or proof rules indicating how a reasoning engine should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax commonly used for such a rule is simple. Every rule consists of a single horizontal line. Above the line, several assumptions can be written, while a single conclusion must be written below it. Such a rule indicates that if the assumptions are met, the conclusion must be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a proof rule or a logic rule, the conclusion is a statement that is guaranteed to be true if the assumptions can be shown to be true using the same or other rules in the system. In the context of type systems, such a rule indicates that if the constructs in the assumptions are shown to have the specified types (using rules of the system), then the construct in the statement is shown to have the desired type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example in the context of type systems. The expression 'x + y' can be shown to have type number if both x and y are numbers, while it can shown to be of type string if one of them is a string."

    "The way these rules are defined above is very restrictive and is generally unsufficient to describe interesting type systems.

For example, a program that sets x to a number if some condition is true, or to a string otherwise.\n",
