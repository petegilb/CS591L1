    "# SQLAlchemy and Object Relational Model (ORMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL-based relational databases are a great way to store and query relational data. SQL database systems (e.g. Postgres) are optimized for fast query of data and efficient storage, via a variety of techniques such as indexing or compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL provides us with a descriptive language that allows us to create and modify schemas (e.g. the structure of tables and their relations), as well as inserting, updating, and querying data. SQL is a domain specific language. It does not have any programming capabilities beyond database functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems are commonly used as a backend data store for applications, especially web and mobile applications. Large applications of this sort are written in a variety of layers and languages. Common backends languages including Python and node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "This poses a challenge. Backends written in Python or similar languages must be able to interact with database systems through SQL. Legacy designs suggest embedding SQL commands into the backend in a naive way: the SQL commands are written as string literals in the backend program, and then passed to some intermediate interface or driver responsible for passing them to the database system, and retrieving the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique was very popular in the early days of backend and web development. However, it had several drawbacks. First, since the SQL statements in the backend are string literals, manipulating them was restricted to string operations, such as concatenation or template instatiations, which is somewhat low level. Second, writing SQL statements as string literals meant little IDE and toolchain support for them, it also is very error prone. Third, such a design posed several vulnerabilities, SQL commands were represented as string literals and assigned to variables, which by definition were used throughout the backend, and sometimes modified. Every access or modification to a variable like that posed an attack surface (or a potential bug) for hackers to abuse. A prime example of such vulnerability is [SQL-injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection).\n",
    "\n",
    "As backend development became increasingly important, its toolchains and frameworks received increased attention from the community. This led to the invention of ORMs. SQLalchemy is one of the most popular and mature ORMs available for python. ORMs embed SQL into their host language in a more sophisticated way. Developers can issue SQL commands without having to write SQL statements explicitly as strings. Instead, developers use typical constructs of the host language to represent the query logically, which is automatically translated into **safe** SQL statements via the ORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORMs are generally a deep embedding. Constructs provided by the ORM (e.g. the capability to query data from a database) are represented as data types (e.g. classes and objects) in the host language, that are defined and provided by the ORM, which can be manipulated by the developers via the ORM's API, to issue SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SQL is based on the concepts of tables and relationship (e.g. foreign keys) between them, ORMs are based on classes and objects. An ORM allows developers to represent a table as a class in the host language. Rows in that table are then represented as objects that are instances of the corresponding class. A relationship between tables is represented via references between the associated objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of using a statement like this:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username='foo' AND password='bar';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An ORM supports achieving the same effect via class and objects in the host language:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# User is a class representing the users table\n",
    "User.query(User.user_id).filter(AND(User.username=='foo', User.password=='bar'))\n",
    "```"

    "# SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will focus specifically on SQLAlchemy as a sample ORM. SQLAlchemy is a terrific use case for studying embedded frameworks, since it uses a lot of the techniques we covered in class previously, so that it can achieve a friendly deep embedding into Python, that interfaces with SQL and databases. These notes follow closely this [great SQLAlchemy tutorial](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/tutorial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial has more details about SQLAlchemy's capabilites and API, while the notes focus on providing a high level summary of the capabilities, and certain aspects that are interesting from an embedding point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of using SQLAlchemy is to connect it to the desired database system. This is achieved via creating an **engine**, which is the SQLAlchemy intermediate layer that sits between the developers python code, and the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine is responsible for communicating with the database system, including sending and receiving network messages if the database is remote. The engine is also responsible for generating SQL queries that correspond to the developers code, using the syntax and features of the specific database system it is connected to. It is also responsible for parsing the results of queries into their corresponding python objects and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an engine, all you really need to do is provide SQLAlchemy with the address of the database to connect to. Below, we will connect to an in-memory sqlite database. This assumes that your computer has sqlite3 installed."

    "# Schema Declaration via SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema of a database specifies the structure of its tables. This includes the name of all tables, and each column inside them. This includes the name and type of each column (e.g. a number or a date or text), as well as any other properties or conditions of that column (e.g. marking a column as having only unique values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, a table can be defined in SQL via an insert statement. For example, this statement defines a table of authors, each with an ID a first name and a last name:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "CREATE TABLE authors(\n",
    "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n",
    "    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    last_name TEXT NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the sytnax of SQL is standardized between all database systems (for most statements). Certain types and \n",
    "features are different or unique to specific database systems. For example, not all systems support AUTOINCREMENT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declarative Base\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define tables and schemas through SQLAlchemy via python constructs. Namely, we defined a table by defining a python class. Not every python class we define in an application will be a table. We can mark certain class as tables by inheriting from a special **declarative base** class that SQLAlchemy provides us.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our tables defined. It is time to add some data to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy supports data manipulation via regular python manipulation of objects. This includes inserting, updating, and deleting of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session and Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy supports transactions in the ACID model. A transaction consists of several commands, which may include data manipulation, queries, and even schema manipulation. A transaction is initiated before all of its commands, and is then populated with commands one at a time. A transaction can be committed, at which point its commands are committed to the database. Transactions can also be rolled back (e.g. in the case of errors), at which point their effects are undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID stands for:\n",
    "1. Atomicity: Each transaction is atomic. Either all of its commands are committed, or all of them fail.\n",
    "2. Consistency: If a transaction is committed, then all of it commands are consistent with the database constraints (e.g. it never sets the value of a column to null if the column is not allowed to be null).\n",
    "3. Isolation: changes made by a transaction do not affect other concurrent transaction, unless that transaction was committed, or the changes were asked to be flushed explicitly.\n",
    "4. Durable: committed transaction are indeed committed in the database physically, and they will survive future errors or crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction in SQLAlchemy is implemented as part of the session abstraction. A session is an SQLAlchemy object that can be populated with commands and manipulation. The sessions provides a **commit** and **rollback** functions that can be used to manipulate the underlying transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the session provides a **flush** function, which can be used to flush the changes made so far to the database, so that their effects are visible to other transactions and queries. Even if some commands are flushed successfully, future commands in the same transaction may cause errors, which will cause the entire transaction to rollback, including the flushed commands. This is not the case for **committed** commands, which will never get rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions are created via a session maker. A session maker can be configured initially by providing an engine, and then used to create new sessions. This is shown below. Note that this is a simple [factory pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SQLAlchemy supports several optional parameters that can be provided at the SessionMaker or the session level. Most noteably autoflush and autocommit, which default to True and False respectively, which specify whether any given command is immediately flushed or committed. A session with autocommit=False can be committed explicitly by calling .commit().\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction/session API of SQLAlchemy is very extensive, and include a variety of configurable parameters, as well as support for manual management of transactions, subtransactions, and other customizable behavior. For more details, look at the [sqlalchemy session docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html)."

It also supports eager and lazy joins (more on that later), as well as a variety of aggregators.\n",

One can achieve a similar functionality to a filter query by retrieving all the rows, and performing the filter in python via a for-loop and an if statement. However, this will be much slower:\n",
