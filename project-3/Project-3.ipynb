   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "In this problem, you task is to implement an MPC version of blackjack using JIFF. You can find all the files you need for this problem in the [course github repo](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "A big problem with several card and board games is cheating. Most of these games require each player to keep a secret state, and do operations consistent with it. Sometimes, it is difficult to check if the operations were indeed consistent without revealing the secret state.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is blackjack. This is a card game between a dealer and a player. The dealer is responsible with providing the player with **random** cards. However, if the dealer does not shuffle the cards properly, or can see the cards as they are being served. The dealer is almost always guaranteed to win. This is a problem with in-person blackjack, as certain dealers may be very skilled with shuffling and marking cards, but it is a bigger problem with electronic blackjack, since the dealer's computer has access to all the information about the cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this issue, we will use MPC. The dealer and player will jointly sample cards randomly using MPC, so that neither of them knows which cards the other got.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackjack is a simple game with a few rules. You can play it online to learn the rules (for example [here](https://www.arkadium.com/games/blackjack/)). We will not support any betting in our implementation. It is strictly for fun. We will only consider one player and one dealer. The dealer will have id 1, and the player will have id 2. We will also consider slightely simpler rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Setup phase: (25 points)\n",
    "1. We have a collection of cards with numerical values (more on this later).\n",
    "2. At the start of the game, the player is given a random card, then the dealer is given a random card. Both cards are shown to both players (they are public).\n",
    "3. Then, the player is given another random public card, while the dealer is given a random secret card, that no one can see yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Player's turn: (15 points)\n",
    "1. Now it is the player's turn. The player looks at their card, and can choose either to receive another random card or to stop. All received cards are public.\n",
    "2. This is repeated until the player chooses to stop. If the player card values exceed 21, the player looses immediately.\n",
    "2. If the player decides to stop, and their cards value do not exceed 21, then it is the dealer's turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dealer's turn: (10 points)\n",
    "1. The dealer' other card is revealed to everyone.\n",
    "2. If the value of the dealer's cards is less than 17, the dealer must take another random card. If it is greater or equal to 17, the dealer must stop. This is repeated until 17 or greater is reached.\n",
    "3. If the dealer's cards value exceeds 21, they loose. Otherwise, the one with the highest value wins. If both player and dealer have the same value, then it is a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you can implement the game as a command line game with a simple UI. The basic building blocks for this UI is given to you in [UI.js](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/Problem1/UI.js). The UI.js file contains usage sample to demonstrate how to use its API. You can also run it using `node UI.js`. This file provides four functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. display(dealers_hand, players_hand): displays the two hands in a nice way, each hand is an array of strings or numbers.\n",
    "2. readBoolean(): prompts the player with a message asking whether to take a new card or stop. Returns a promise that resolves to true if the user asks for a new card, or false otherwise.\n",
    "3. clear(): clears the screen.\n",
    "4. stop(): stops the interface, use this when everything is done to close the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the user's input through the UI, certain code/actions (like sampling) must be performed by both players. The player code must communicate the user's input to the dealer. JIFF provides an `emit` and `listen` API that supports such communication. Sample usage is shown in the given skeleton files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MPC\n",
    "\n",
    "The MPC component of this problem is really random sampling, to ensure that cards are indeed random. JIFF provides a `<instance>.bits.rejection_sampling(...)` function, that allows parties to jointly sample a uniform number in a specified range using MPC. The problem files contain sample usage of this function to demonstrate how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this function by itself will not be sufficient to achieve true random sampling: after the first card is drawn randomly, consequent random draws should never draw that same card again! This means that you have to store all the cards that were drawn before in some array, and every time a new draw is made, make sure that it is not in that array, if it is, you will have to call rejection\\_sampling again, until the card drawn is not in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT: most cards are public, only some are secret. Think about which ones are, and try to do most of the comparisons to check if a card has been seen before or not in the clear (not under MPC).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use a single deck of cards for Blackjack. A card consists of two things: a suite and a value. Cards generally range between an ACE to a king. For our simplified version of blackjack, we will consider an ace to be 1, a Jack, Queen and King to be 11, 12, 13 respectively, the other cards range between 2-10 inclusive. For a total of 13 different values. Decks usually have 4 suites in them, to simplify things, we will refer to them using numbers 0-3 inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify things, your code can work with suites and values as plain numbers as above. You may also display them to the user that way, so you do not have to worry about representing special cards (J, Q, K, and Ace) or suites as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Clone the course's github repo and update all its submodules and install the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1\n",
    "git submodule init\n",
    "git submodule update # may take a couple of minutes\n",
    "cd project-3/Problem1\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to project-3/problem-1 diretory: We provide two skeleton files for you there: [player.js](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/Problem1/player.js), [dealer.js](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/Problem1/dealer.js). Additionally, we provide complete implementations of the needed JIFF server [server.js](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/Problem1/server.js) and interface [UI.js](https://github.com/KinanBab/CS591L1/tree/master/project-3/Problem1/UI.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run these files to see what the code samples in them do. You can also run the UI file using `node UI.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# run each of these commands in a different terminal\n",
    "node server.js\n",
    "node dealer.js\n",
    "node player.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest you follow these steps when trying to solve this problem:\n",
    "1. Look at the provided files and run them, understand the rules as above, try blackjack out online or on a piece of paper.\n",
    "2. Ignore suites, and consider only a single set of cards between 1 and 13 inclusive. Implement the setup phase with these cards only.\n",
    "3. Add the suites into your implementation. You can do this by sampling a card using two calls to rejection\\_sampling: the first samples the suite from \\[0-3\\], and the second samples the value from \\[1-13\\]. Make sure the setup phase is still correct.\n",
    "4. Organize your code so that card drawing, including checking that a card has not been drawn before, is factored out into a single re-usable functions.\n",
    "5. Implement the player's phase, use the card drawing function described above.\n",
    "6. Implement the dealer's phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT: You only need to perform secret comparison between a newly drawn card and the dealer's secret card. All other comparisons can be performed outside MPC. Notice that in the dealer's turn, the secret card is revealed!**\n"
